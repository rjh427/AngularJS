Assignment instructions:

Refactor the 04.ngMadLibs assignment to use a controller. The end product should have the same look and functionality.

The instructions call for creating an "add a controller" branch, performing the refactoring in the new branch, then merging that branch back into the master branch. I'm doing that as part of the 05 assignment directory, while preserving the 04 assignment directory as originally completed.

An additional challenge: Support Male and Female names. Set a scope variable for gender, give users a way to set it in the template, and modify the rendered Mad Lib template so that it conditionally displays gender appropriate language (e.g., substituting he/she, him/her, his/her as necessary) according to the gender chosen for the name.

When complete, this assignment should be viewable at http://rjh427.github.io/AngularJS/05.ngMagLibs-R1/
