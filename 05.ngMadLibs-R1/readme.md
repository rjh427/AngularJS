Refactor Assignment 04 to add a controller.

Additional Challenge: Support Male and Female Names: Set a scope variable for gender, give users a way to set it in your template, and modify the rendered Mad Lib template so that it conditionally displays gender appropriate language (e.g., substituting he/she, him/her, his/her as necessary) according to gender chosen for name.
