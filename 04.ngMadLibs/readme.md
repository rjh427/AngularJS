Assignment instructions:

Your app must achieve a high approximation of the sketch (and colors are true to original!)

You must use the following image assets, which you can save to your project directory for this assignment:

    ngMadLibs Logo
    ngMadLibs Smiley face

You're free to create your own Mad Libs text from scratch, if you want.

For this version of the app, when a user inputs text in any of the inputs at the top of the page, the text at the bottom should update automatically. For instance, when you set the value of "male name" to "Sam" in the top of the interface, all instances of the {{male name}} placeholder text should be replaced with "Sam".

When you've completed this assignment, save it to GitHub. Share a link to the page and your GitHub repo on Slack and with your Mentor.

Be ready to discuss your app and the decisions you made with your Mentor at your next session.
